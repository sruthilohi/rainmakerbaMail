        <p>Implementation of analytics programs often fails due to the lack of or low quality of available data. The first action
        Rainmaker BA performs on a new client is a maturity assessment on the company’s information architecture and data
        sources based on analytical requirements. Transactional, aggregated, and operational information is scored for quality,
        and the existing infrastructure’s ability to support new sources and data feed is evaluated.The time required to
        acquire, clean, and analyze new data is evaluated and built into the adjustment period. Businesses with multiple systems
        and large stores of data often struggle with duplicate data, out-of-date records, junk data, including falsified, or
        unverified content and missing information. Rainmaker BA can implement approaches that ensure data quality that includes
        processes such as de-duplication, refreshment, synchronization, cleansing, enrichment.</p>
        <p>Understanding the nature of data available and the method of data capture is important. It is simple to identify,
        extract and leverage the data that resides in structured systems, such as databases and ERP, CRM and SCM applications.
        However, to parse unstructured content and then turn it into usable information—especially in an automated environment
        is challenging. In current times, the bulk of the information of companies is present in business documents, emails,
        social media texts/images – data that is unstructured. The challenge is to capture, catalog and prepare this data for
        use by analytical models to unlock valuable information that can drive productivity, shrink cycle times, improve
        decision making and boost the bottom line. Periodic audits of the data capture process are also important to evaluate
        its fit with the operational process. This will ensure that the right information is identified, extracted, and then
        delivered to applications as needed.</p>

    <p>Automating the data capture can provide incremental benefits to the analytics program. This capability will enable us to
    provide new offerings that respond to changes in customer demand and manage seasonal staffing fluctuations, allowing
    businesses to remain competitive by boosting productivity and digitally replicating customer experiences multifold
    times. Automating data capture allows flexibility and scalability to generate data-driven insights that are correlated
    to user experience. Automating data capture increases corporate agility, allowing organizations to quickly respond to
    market changes and new customer demands, which ensures they stay competitive in an always-changing, fast-moving world.</p>
