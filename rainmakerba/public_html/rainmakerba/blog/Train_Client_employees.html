        <p>Having a cross-functional analytics team that encompasses functions of technology, business, operations, legal, and HR
        can help full-scale adoption of analytics in every department. Lack of teamwork among these cross-sections of
        departments can hamper analytics-driven initiatives. Poor collaboration creates the risk that analytics may not get the
        relevant data and will not be able to provide the information promised. This may result in distrust of the analytics
        program and eventually to its abandonment. Training of personnel in analytics concepts, practices and benefits can
        mitigate these risks.</p>
        <p>There are many approaches to train and immerse employees in analytics. Rainmaker BA recommends empowering employees to
        easily access data and actionable insights as paramount in analytics training. All key employees need to be aware of the
        available data, analytics metrics, and KPIs - for their department and the entire organisation. A common understanding
        and interpretation of the Metrics and KPIs related to analytics needs to be established across all levels of the
        organization. This analytics dictionary must be accessible by all authorized users and packaged in the right business
        context.</p>

    <p>Employees need to be trained in technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Analytics and Visualization. Awareness
      of
      these areas can be raised via several educational activities and events. Rainmaker BA conducts information sharing
      activities through group sessions. These sessions highlight success stories where data to smart decisions resulting in
      measurable financial or operational impact. Formal training sessions on data analysis technology is also a great tool
      to
      train employees into an analytical mindset. Conducting mini-hackathons and prediction competition on known data sets
      for
      employees are other approaches used to train employees.</p>
