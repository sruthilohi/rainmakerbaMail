          <p>Rainmaker BA can assist companies in pl anning for digital transformation and gain a competitive edge by creating
          business value with the use of data and analytics. For achieving effective data and analytics transformations, several
          factors must be managed concurrently. Rainmaker BA can guide companies to answer core questions such as whether digital
          transformation capabilities should address only improving the core operations or also include the launching of entirely
          new business models.</p>
          <p>Digital Transformation requires answering fundamental questions on data strategy such as for what the data and analytics
          will be used for, what nature of insights from data analysis will create value and which data sets can create actionable
          insights. Implementing an analytics program will require solving problems related to data generation, collection, and
          organization. Rainmaker BA can enable Clients to capture more data from customer interactions, supply chains, equipment,
          and internal processes. It is to be noted that while these new streams of data create business opportunities, they also
          simultaneously increase ambiguity, noise, and complexity.</p>

      <p>Implementing an analytics program will require Client personnel to acquire skills needed to derive insights from data
        and use these insights into decision making. This required changing business processes to incorporate data insights
        into
        the actual workflow. Success will depend on providing the right data insights into the hands of decision-makersâ€”and
        making sure that these executives and mid-level managers understand how to use data-driven insights.</p>
          <p>Putting all these components in place for implementing a business analytics program is not easy. To create business
          value using data analytics, the company needs the right data, right technology, talent and culture. Acceptance of the
          business analytics culture can become a formidable task. Business analytics is still an area viewed with distrust by
          many top-level executives. In many instances, employees and teams are not ready to discover, interpret and use the data
          in decision-making processes. Rainmaker BA can help Clients to develop intra-organizational trust in data-based decision
          making. This will be achieved by presenting business analytics as supportive of existing company strategies and
          outlining clear, measurable goals that will convince slow adopters to approve a trial project.</p>
          <p>Insights into real business problems from analytics will be visualized as data stories to increase understanding and
          acceptability. We at Rainmaker BA are passionate to develop a special mindset in our Client organizations, i.e. a shared
          mentality that recognizes data and insights as a catalyst towards more objective and efficient decision-making
          processes.</p>
          <p>Any investment in business needs to be based on Return on Investment (ROI) considerations. Rainmaker BA can develop KPIs
          for the analytics program that will measure the readiness and culture of the analytical program. This will involve
          measurement systems that capture how employees are accessing, sharing, and using analytics. These KPIs will foster
          accountability, data-driven innovation, and continuous improvement.</p>
